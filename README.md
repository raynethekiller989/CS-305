# CS-305
Artemis Financial specializes in creating financial services that empower consumers to select plans that best suit their needs. The company places a strong emphasis on security, ensuring that data is transmitted safely and protected from unauthorized access. I found conducting dependency testing valuable for identifying potential vulnerabilities. Writing secure code is crucial in reducing the risk of exploitable weaknesses. Robust software security not only strengthens a company’s credibility but also builds trust, helping to attract more clients.
Working on the vulnerabilities that the client has allowed me to create a code to help suppress the false positives. It was difficult for me to get the HTTPS to work in the code. I created the certificate to help make it work but it did not want to work no matter what I tried. Looking ahead, I plan to focus on assessing vulnerabilities and determining mitigation techniques by accurately identifying false positives.
To verify that the code and software application were functional and secure, I ran the project multiple times, including dependency checks. After refactoring the code, I ran the project again to detect any new vulnerabilities. A valuable resource for me in the future will be viewing projects in the web browser within Eclipse. One assignment I’d like to highlight is my Vulnerability Assessment Report, where I demonstrated my ability to find and interpret relevant information.
